### What is ConnectALL?
Our project is a curated online repository of internet/computer skill tutorials created by a nationwide community of “tech helpers” as a mobile-friendly, responsive web-application. Our web app ships with a basic suite of digital literacy tutorials designed to help teach people the basic skills and knowledge needed to eliminate the digital divide.

### How did this start?
In the Obama Administration's [recent initiative](make.sc/whitehouse) he calls on the tech community to help the United States move more of its population on to the Internet. This is our response, directly and in collaboration with the White House. We are building a platform to help librarians and "tech helpers" around the country better assist those looking to become connected. This project is open-source--any help is appreciated!

### Who are we?
We are four students from [Make School](http://makeschool.com), a two-year college alternative dedicated to computer science and entrepreneurship.  Make School is located in San Francisco, CA.

### How can you help?
Like any open-source project, we welcome pull requests! We are looking for volunteers with the technical skills necessary to help us build and maintain this project.  Alternatively, you can help by logging on to the web app and creating content in the form of tutorials!

### What Technologies leveraged?
Our current stack is *Ruby on Rails* with *Bootstrap*.

### Git Guidelines
1. All git commits will be present tense
2. Follow the workflow

### Team Workflow
0. Git status and remove things from stagint that don't belong `git status` & `git rm <filename>`
1. Fetch and merge changes from the remote `git fetch` & `git merge origin/master`
2. Create a branch to work on a new project feature `git branch <new_feature_name>`
3. Develop the feature on your branch and commit your work `git commit -m "<present tense commit message"`
4. Fetch and merge from the remote again (in case new commits were made while you were working) `git fetch` & `git merge origin/master`
5. Push your branch up to the remote for review `git push origin <your_branch_name>`

*Steps 1 and 4 are a safeguard against merge conflicts*
