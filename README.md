### What is Connect All?
Curated online repository of internet/computer skill tutorials created by “tech helpers” nationwide as a mobile-friendly, responsive web-application.  The web-app ships with a basic suite of tutorials designed to help teach people the basic skills and knowledge needed to eliminate the digital divide.

### How did this start?
In President Obama's [recent initiative](make.sc/whitehouse) he calls on the tech community to help the United States move more of it's population on to the Internet. This is our response, directly in collaboration with the White House, we are building a platform to help librarians and tech-helpers around the country better assist those looking to become connected. This project best serves it's goals by being open source, and would appreciate any assistance that could be provided.

### Who are we?
We are four students from [Make School](http://makeschool.com) a two-year college alternative dedicated to computer-science and entrepreneurship located in San Francisco, CA. 

### What Technologies leveraged?
Our current stack is *Ruby on Rails* with *Angular*. 

### Git Guidelines
1. All git commits will be present tense
2. Follow the workflow

### Team Workflow
1. Fetch and merge changes from the remote `git fetch` & `git merge origin/master`
2. Create a branch to work on a new project feature `git branch <new_feature_name>`
3. Develop the feature on your branch and commit your work `git commit -m "<present tense commit message"`
4. Fetch and merge from the remote again (in case new commits were made while you were working) `git fetch` & `git merge origin/master`
5. Push your branch up to the remote for review `git push origin <your_branch_name>`

*Steps 1 and 4 are a safeguard against merge conflicts*
