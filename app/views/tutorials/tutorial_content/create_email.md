#### Prerequisites

In order to understand this tutorial, you need to know how to:

* Use a keyboard/mouse

#### Introduction

In the modern world, its not just necessary to have an email address--it's essential.  
People use the email as a quick and unobtrusive way to send and receive information,
sign up for goods and services.  This tutorial will teach you how to create and use a
basic email account.  

#### Step 1: Choose a provider

Before you can sign up for an email account, you'll need to decide what company you
would like to use.  This a free service provided by hundreds of companies on the internet--
there is *no reason* to pay for an email account.  If you don't know where to start,
I  recommend using one of the major companies for your email account, such as
Google's Gmail or Yahoo Mail.  These are services used by *billions* of people, so they are a
pretty safe choice.

####  Step 2: Sign Up

In order to get started, you'll need to click on the link that says "Sign Up".  Here's a basic picture of
each page highlighting the link that you'll need to click.  **These pages may look a little different by the time
that you view this tutorial, but the link will still be there somewhere, so don't panic!**

Now, you'll need to enter your info.  The information they ask for may vary from service to service,
but they'll generally need your first and last name, birth day, phone number, etc.  You'll also need to decide
what your email address will be!  This is the part of your email address that is personal to you--the part to the
left of the @ symbol.  All email addresses can include letters and numbers, and most also allow periods. If your first choice is taken, don't be afraid to change up the spelling or add some numbers to the end.  You do **not** have to use your full name, or even any part of your real name when choosing your email address.

Continue through your provider's sign up process.  Don't be surprised if you need to confirm that you are not a robot!  It's normal for websites to text you a verification code that you'll need to enter, or have you enter numbers from a picture or "CAPCHA" to prove you're a real person.

 Once you've completed the signup process and chosen an email address and password, your web browser may ask you if you would like the browser to remember these for you. This is fine if you are on your own device, but if you are on a public computer, **do not** do this! As a rule, always keep your password to yourself!   

#### Step 3:  Send yourself a test email!

Congratulations! you're now the proud owner of your very own email address.    Make sure you remember your username and password--you'll need these to sign in every time you access your email.  For ease of access, you may also want to bookmark the sign in page for email address--this will save you time whenever you want to check your email, but isn't strictly required.  

Once you've signed in to your email account, you'll likely already have a few emails in your inbox from your provider.  These emails are meant to walk you through the process of using their email service.  Don't be afraid to take the time to read them if you're unsure about anything!

To test that our email account works (and to get familiarize ourselves with the process of sending an email), lets send ourselves a message.  On the side of the page, there is a button that says "Compose".  Click that button to begin writing your first email.

Type your own email address into the bar that says "To".  Just like writing an address on a package, the email address you put in this box will determine who this email gets sent to.  Since we're just creating a test message, go ahead and enter your own email.  *Be sure to include the entire email address, including the @[something].com at the end!*

Now, you'll need give your message a subject line, and some actual text in the body.  Anything will do.

Finally, we click the "Send" button at the bottom of the page. You should see the message appear in your own inbox very quickly after you send it.

Congratulations!  You have now created your own email address.  You'll use this email address to send and receive messages, and to sign up for all the cool things the internet has to offer.
